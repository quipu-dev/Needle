"FileSystemOperator": |-
  A scanning Executor Operator that recursively loads resources from a directory.

  It mimics the logic of the legacy FileSystemLoader:
  1. Scans the root directory recursively.
  2. Handles nested directories and __init__.json files.
  3. Flattens the entire structure into a single key-value map during initialization.
"FileSystemOperator.__call__": |-
  Resolves a pointer to a string value.

  Example:
  `op(L.app.title)` -> Loads `root/app.json` -> Returns value of key "title".

  Returns `None` if the file does not exist or the key is not found.
"FileSystemOperator.__init__": |-
  Initializes the operator with a specific root directory.
  This directory is usually a specific language folder (e.g., `.../assets/en`).
